# Programming-Foundations-with-JavaScript-HTML-and-CSS

*Currently working in processing.*

Thanks for the Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS course from Duke University on coursera( https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web/home/welcome). This reporsitory is to record my study progress and the projects mentioned in this course.

Each folder contains the materials and exercises for each week.

 - Week 1 covers how to create a webpage using HTML, the language that defines the structure of the webpage, as well as CSS, the language that makes change the appearance of the webpage easily. Currently it looks bad but the main purpose of this is to practice my learning from coursera including the structure of webpage, formatting each section, and inserting lists, tables, pictures, as well as links. Design the webpage in a fancy way is unfortunately not covered in this course but will try to make everything look better after feeling comfortable with my coding skills.
 - Week 2 has three parts:
 
   **Part 1**: Write a JavaScript program that modifies an image by putting three vertical stripes on it - a red stripe on the left one third, a green stripe in the middle, and a blue stripe on the right one third.
   
   **Part 2**: Write a JavaScript function named swapRedGreen with one parameter pixel (representing a single pixel). This function should swap the red and green values of the pixel. For example, if you have a pixel with red = 255, green = 100, blue = 150, after calling swapRedGreen on that pixel its new RGB values would be red = 100, green = 255, blue = 150.
   
   **Part 3**: Write code to change the Duke blue devil to be yellow.
