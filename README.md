# Programming-Foundations-with-JavaScript-HTML-and-CSS

*Currently working in processing.*

Thanks for the Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS course from Duke University on coursera( https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web/home/welcome). This reporsitory is to record my study progress and the projects mentioned in this course.

Each folder contains the materials and exercises for each week.

 - Week 1 covers how to create a webpage using HTML, the language that defines the structure of the webpage, as well as CSS, the language that makes change the appearance of the webpage easily. Currently it looks bad but the main purpose of this is to practice my learning from coursera including the structure of webpage, formatting each section, and inserting lists, tables, pictures, as well as links. Design the webpage in a fancy way is unfortunately not covered in this course but will try to make everything look better after feeling comfortable with my coding skills.
